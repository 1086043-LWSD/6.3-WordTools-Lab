# 6.3 WordTools Lab
## Line-Based Scanners and Data Algorithms

Given a paragraph from a data file (“text.txt”), create three static methods to find the word count, longest word, and shortest word in each line of the paragraph.

Instructions:
  1.	Load the starter code
  2.	In VS Code, File > Open Folder
  3.	Navigate to: *repo root*\Chapter 6 – File IO\6.3 WordTools Lab
  4.	Choose the folder “6.3 WordTools Lab”
  5.	Click “Select Folder”
  6.	Follow the instructions found in the source code comments in the file “WordTools.java”

This lab will be graded on a rubric similar to the FRQs: comparing it to a canonical solution, checking for correct implementation of certain methods, and checking for correct solutions.

Objectives:
  1.	Implement the code changes as directed by the comments in the code
  2.	Make a changelist, write a summary for your changes, then commit and push your changes to your private repo
  3.	Verify that you have successfully checked in working code to your Github repository
