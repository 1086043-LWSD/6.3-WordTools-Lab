# 6.3 WordTools Lab
## Line-Based Scanners and Data Algorithms

Goal: 
Given a text file, create three static methods to find the word count, longest word, and shortest word of each line in the file.
This lab will assess your ability to use File, Scanner, and Scanner methods to create line-based scanners and data algorithms.

Instructions:
  1.	Load the starter code in the file "WordTools.java"
  2.	You will be given the text file "text.txt", a main method that calls the methods wordCount, shortestWord, and longestWord, and the headers for those methods
  3.	Follow the source code comments to implement the wordCount, shortestWord, and longestWord methods and complete the WordTools program

NOTE: Do not make any changes to the text.txt file or main method.

To submit your code for grading:
  1.	Make a changelist, write a summary for your changes, then commit and push your changes to your private repo
  2.	Verify that you have successfully checked in working code to your Github repository

This lab will be graded on a rubric similar to the FRQs: comparing it to a canonical solution, checking for correct implementation of certain methods, and checking for correct solutions. (see ScoringGuidelines.md for more information)
