# Scoring Guidelines

## Canonical Solution
See `WordToolsSolution.java` for a canonical solution.

##  Your code should include:
- create a `Scanner` that reads a text file
- create a `Scanner` that reads a line of text
- use a `while` loop to scan each line
- use `Scanner` methods `hasNextLine()`, `nextLine()`, `hasNext()`, and `next()`
- close `Scanner` at the end of each method
- print results and produce correct output
- use correct syntax for all above

## Correct Output
The program should print the following:

```
Line 1 has 26 words.     
Line 2 has 14 words.     
Line 3 has 10 words.     

Line 1's shortest word is: a      
Line 2's shortest word is: Oh     
Line 3's shortest word is: up     

Line 1's longest word is: Feathers
Line 2's longest word is: sticks  
Line 3's longest word is: throwing
```
